# fusion-files

 I built these Files while working with a tutorial/lab that I was pointed to by Aaron Jansen. 
 
 Note: getting Fusion up and running is a concern but right now I need to support our classic install so that is the priority.
 
 When that is up I can get back to fusion, if needed install it on seperate computer, if running both environments(not at the same time) is dicey.
