## Lab 00
In this lab you will setup your repository to run Fusion and PageBuilder editor locally.

1. Make sure you're on the branch `USERNAME-fusion-training` you created from `master` in the previous step.

2. Start fusion
```
npx fusion start
```

3. Load the following link once fusion has finished loading (it might take a few minutes)
```
http://localhost/pagebuilder/pages
```
You should see this page

Note: you may see an alert warning of an error with content sources. Disregard this; we will address content sources later on.

4. Create a folder called `mocks` in the root of the repo. We need to create a few mock files to give your local user permissions as well as your local version of PageBuilder data of all the Sites that exist for your organization.

5. In `mocks`, add the file `/mocks/user` with the following content:

```
{
   "displayName": "Local Developer",
   "permissions": {
     "PageBuilder": {
       "global": [
         "W",
         "D",
         "P",
         "VRP",
         "ERP",
         "DT"
       ]
     }
   }
 } 
```

Also add the file `/mocks/siteservice/api/v3/website` with the following content. NOTE: if you have a site set up in your organizations [Arc environment](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/siteservice), update the `_id` and `display_name` value below with that site's values:

```
[
  {
    "_id": "demo",
    "display_name": "Demo",
    "is_default_website": true
  }
]
```

9. Open the file called `.env` from the root of your project directory. Remove the `#` so that the lines are no longer commented out. Leave `CONTENT_BASE` and `FUSION_RELEASE` as they are. You will need to update the content base and add an access token for your API through the following steps:
    - Go to your orgs Arc homepage and switch to the sandbox environment.
    - Click on Developer Center and click "create read-only token".
    - Fill in the fields and click create. This will create your access token.
    - Copy the content at the bottom where it says "Copy the following into your PB .env file if setting up PageBuilder" and place it into your `.env`. It should be something like this:

```
CONTENT_BASE=https://api.sandbox.{org}.arcpublishing.com 
ARC_ACCESS_TOKEN={token_here}
```

These variables give your local instance of Fusion and PageBuilder access to your organizations sandbox content (articles, videos, galleries, etc).
